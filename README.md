# Loan Risk Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan applicant is High Risk or Low Risk using Machine Learning classification techniques. It helps reduce loan default risk by making data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement
Loan defaults cause financial losses. The objective of this project is to classify loan applicants based on their risk level using historical data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature engineering
- Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE and class weights

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

## Model Deployment
The final model is deployed using Streamlit with:
- Input form for user details
- Prediction output: High Risk / Low Risk

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run Streamlit app
